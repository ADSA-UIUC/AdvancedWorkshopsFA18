This is the UIUC-ADSA Fall 2018 Python Crash Course as part of our advanced workshops series.

This material is meant to be a refresher on Python syntax for those with programming experience.

Links to the online Google Colaboratory notebooks can be found within the slides.

The .ipynb files are included in the Notebook folder if you prefer a local instance.
